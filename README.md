========================================

Getting and Cleaning Data course project

The R script that has been included in this repository, carries out the necessary data transformations and processing done to produce the final tidy data set.

The transformations have been explained in the CodeBook.md file also included in the repository.

The tidy data set has been uploaded to the course project page as a .txt file as a .csv file is not accepted. To view the data set the file will have to be downloaded and extension changed to .csv. This is an approach suggested by the course TA.
